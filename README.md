## Experiments with Cordova plugins

Testing on Android device for background and foreground service behavior. And how Notifications behave.

Below are the plugins I have experimented with (up to commit [`4997b80`](https://github.com/marckassay/DemoNumber5/commits/master) was using cordova-plugin-foreground-service):

- [cordova-plugin-foreground-service](https://github.com/DavidBriglio/cordova-plugin-foreground-service)

- [cordova-plugin-background-mode](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-background-mode)
